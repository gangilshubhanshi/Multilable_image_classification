# Multi lable image classification

This project involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for classifying images based on the presence of various biomes such as trees, sea, sunset, mountain, and desert.






## Getting started
To run this project notebook, follow these steps:

1)Download the notebook and model file and open it in Kaggle.

2)Execute the cells in the notebook.

3)Make sure that the directories are properly set up.
## Model weights
The model weights are included in the file named 'Model_15ep_0.001lrAdam_recent.h5'. You can find the trained weights in this file.
## Using the Trained Model
In the notebook, you have the option to load the trained model and use the predict_images(image_path, model) function to predict the labels for images. Provide the image_path as the path to the image you want to classify. Pass the loaded or trained model as the model parameter.
## Dataset
The training dataset used for this project is the "miml_image_data," which is available on Kaggle.
